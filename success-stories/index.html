	<p class="story-text">To Whom it May Concern,<br />
I am writing today in reference to RJ Executive Search. I am the Regional Human Resources Manager. I have been working with Shelley and Meredith over the past year to recruit some very challenging positions for our organization. I actually found their company by searching online for recruiting firms. I contacted them and once I learned of their recruiting process I was sure they could help us. <br />
<br />
We had been searching for over a year to fill a couple high level positions in our organization. Our recruiting challenges are related to compensation packages, company location and being able to reach qualified candidates. Once I gave Shelley and Meredith a summary of our company and what we do, the job descriptions and a list of our competitors they went to work to infiltrate our competitors and find us some very good candidates for the Head of sales and Head of Engineering positions. In addition, they have assisted with other difficult positions such as Field Service Engineers and Project Engineers. <br />
<br />
MJ Direct does a good job of understanding the candidate profiles needed, finding and screening viable candidates, and selling our company and the open positions to the candidates. I strongly recommend MJ Direct Services and firmly believe any organization can benefit from their recruiting services. <br />
<br />

They are true professionals and a great resource in this challenging recruiting environment.

 To Whom It May Concern:<br />
I am the Human Resource Director for a CPG company. Shelley and Meredith helped us find a candidate for our Senior Marketing Manager position. RJ Executive Search met all our expectations and revealed their professionalism in recruiting. They devoted time to carefully interview the job-seekers while being mindful of our needs and requirements for this  role.<br />
Shelley and Meredith went above and beyond to provide us with superior customer service and a vast range of highly qualified candidates. We express our sincere gratitude for such a positive experience with RJ Executive Search, and we will use their professional services for similar projects in the future.<br />
Sincerely,<br />

	<p class="story-text">When our company launched our search for a Regional Sales Manager I was referred to MJ Direct by a colleague who worked for Shelley in the past. Our initial interview was very productive and we were impressed by the commitment to find quality candidates in rapid order. Once the specs were submitted to MJ we had an initial group of very qualified prospects within 10 days. This was impressive especially because our industry fairly specialized and requires both business and technical acumen for a sales manager to be successful. Two of the candidates were so attractive that we made the quick decision to hire them both! Now, 13 months following the new hires, both are thriving and have become real leaders in our company. We feel that Shelley and Meredith are real professionals and deliver on their promises. I highly recommend them as partners.</p>

	<p class="story-text">It is my pleasure to share my appreciation for Shelley Ross, and by relevance, for RJ Executive Search. In my communication with Shelley, she has always presented as a very professional recruiting expert. She engages easily. I was very taken by her industry knowledge of job roles and what they meant to a potential employer.<br />
<br />
It became clear quite quickly that Shelley spent a lot of time on conducting searches and asking the right questions to compile an effective profile of what you may need. She didn&#039;t hesitate to get the details right but I also felt that her attention to your needs was part of her genuine interest in bringing forth the right candidates. This is what makes her a top recruiter because she engages, whether with an individual, company, or in researching the details. <br />
<br />
Shelley is probably one of the few great communicators that you see in a professional and executive recruiter. I also feel this is because she is working in the right setting with RJ Executive Search, since Owner, Meredith Johnson, also exhibits the same qualities. With this team, you are bound to get the right result!  </p>

	<p class="story-text">My name is Janice and I am the Human Resources for a corporation in California. I am writing today in reference to RJ Executive Search. We used RJ Executive Search last year to help us find a Director of Engineering, which was a new position for us. <br />
<br />
I met Meredith Johnson first and with her wonderful personality, we hit it off. I felt confident that our needs would be met. She came in and presented her company to us and we knew we would move forward in our job search with her. I met Shelley Ross next and with her expertise in searching for candidates, we moved forward with our business relationship. <br />
<br />
We had very specific needs in mind for this position. We are a manufacturer that is unique within our industry and needed to hit on a few very specific items. Shelley was very quick to get moving and find us candidates to review. Our wait was short and we were presented with a few candidates that met our criteria. We were impressed and soon were interviewing our candidates. It was narrowed down and we hired our first Director of Engineering. One year later, we couldn&#039;t be happier with our choice and with the process we went through to hire. We will soon be searching for a VP of Sales and Marketing, also a new position for us, and we will definitely call on RJ Executive Search to fill that position too. <br />
<br />
I can confidently recommend MJ Direct Services knowing you will be totally satisfied. They are a company deeply rooted in values and satisfaction and it shows in everything they do. </p>

	<p class="story-text">Meredith worked in helping us source candidates for a niche market sales role. From the first time I spoke with Meredith, I knew she was going to be an excellent partner in recruiting talent. Meredith took the time to get to know the organization, key contributors, the role, and my needs. During the process, Meredith checked in frequently, called to discuss candidates and was always interested in hearing feedback post interviews. Candidates that we spoke with were well prepared and had the experience we were looking for. She made the process very easy and was always engaged. I was impressed with her ability to be available despite our time zone differences. It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to work with Meredith and her name is at the top of my list when it comes to filling challenging roles.</p>

I am the HR Manager and daily I get calls and emails from agencies that would like to help us with hiring. What first caught my eye about RJ Executive Search was the one-year guarantee, something I had never seen another agency offer. From start to finish the team at MJ Direct is great partner to work with, getting to know your company, needs, as well as drilling down on the perfect candidate. We have now worked with MJ Direct in hiring two different positions in different cities and states. I was impressed with the candidate quality and ease of working with the team at MJ Direct, I would highly recommend them!</p>

	<p class="story-text">Shelley, from the very first contact you proved your professional and ethical approach to recruitment. There forward as our mutual interest grew you clearly demonstrated (1) your passion for what you do, (2) your discernment for a proper person/job fit, and (3) most importantly your welcoming venues of communication throughout my weeks long job transition. I could not have asked for a better recruiter to connect with. <br />

	<p class="story-text">Thank you Shelley! Couldn&#039;t have done it without you. As a candidate who wasn&#039;t actively looking, you connected me to an opportunity that I certainly wouldn&#039;t have known existed. That&#039;s a pretty improbable scenario that only comes to fruition when a recruiting professional does the work! </p>

	<p class="story-text">We engaged MJ Direct for the first time in the company on a search for a Product Manager.  This is typically a difficult position to staff as the job title can include vastly different skill sets.  They listened to our requirements and had two highly relevant candidates within a few weeks, if not faster.  Through our interview process, both candidates got votes by the selection group and we had to debate which would be the better candidate for us as both seemed qualified.  Our choice has been on board for over a year now and we&rsquo;re happy with the results.  Job accomplished!</p>

	<p class="story-text">Good Morning Shelley,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to share my experience with Nationwide/Global Executive Recruiting Services. Especially my experience with Christina Finan.<br />
<br />
I have dealt with many recruiting services throughout numerous years as a Supervisor in Food Manufacturing. I was working 3rd Shift (9:15PM-6:30AM) with a 50mi drive one way. Christina called me with an opportunity for a 1st Shift Supervisor Position that was 20min from my house. Obviously, I was interested. <br />
<br />
Most recruiters I have dealt with would take their time and I wouldn&rsquo;t hear back from them in a week or more. Christina, on the other hand gave me daily updates on the position. She would let me know where in the process we were and told me honestly what the company thought of my work history. I would even text her questions throughout the day and she would respond within 15-30min with a positive attitude and never once acted like I was bothering her.<br />
<br />
Christina (and Shelley) walked me through every interview helping me with any questions that could have come up. They were dedicated every step of the way to ensure I was offered this position that would greatly improve my home life as well as career (Company on the rise and promoting quickly). I received an offer that I wanted. I couldn&rsquo;t have done that without their help.<br />
<br />
The whole process from start to finish was stress free. Which amazed me considering the huge impact it would have on my life. I would recommend anyone to work with Nationwide/Global Executive Recruiting Services. Especially with Christina Finan. I thanked them numerous times for all they did for me. I figured writing a testimonial for them would be the least I could do for all they have done for me. Thanks again Christina and Shelley! You are truly the best recruiters I have ever worked with!!<br />
