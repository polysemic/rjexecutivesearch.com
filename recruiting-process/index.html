          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Results, Urgency and Presentation Timeline: </strong>Our recruiting team will determine a timeline based on the specific search requirements, to present our top 3-5 candidates for each recruiting project. We successfully present candidates within 15 - 20 business days from the day you hire our firm. This candidate presentation timeline can be adjusted based upon changes made to original job description and intake call information. All candidates will be presented over a scheduled conference call with our client.</p>

              <h4><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Our Five Successful Phases of Recruiting:</strong></span></h4>
              <p><strong>1. Client Intake/Analysis:</strong> We conduct an in-depth intake meeting with Executive Leadership in order to analyze our client’s specific job description, industry match, culture fit, personality fit and key traits. During this important phase, we will gain the insight of key stakeholders in order to capture both spoken and unspoken critical success factors required for this role. We invest a significant amount of time to fully understand the client’s vision and goals, both short-term and long-term, in order to align the best candidate talent to help our client achieve those goals.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Candidate Identification:</strong> Our research team, as directed by our Head of Recruiting and Client Services, begins the process of building a candidate target list through the identification of industry competitors. The recruitment team begins to directly engage and conduct preliminary screening interviews in order to arrive at a long-list of qualified passive candidate talent. These individuals are not active in their own job search, and most are successfully employed.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Candidate Interview:</strong> The long-listed candidates are taken through an extensive interview process with the expectation that they have attributes and accomplishments in their work history that can be quantified. These can be measured by increasing profits, identifying cost savings or improving a process which will ultimately make a positive impact on your bottom line and a return on our investment in our service.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Candidate Presentation/Interview Scheduling:</strong> Upon successful completion of our interview process, we narrow down to a short list of 3-5 candidates that are presented by a scheduled conference call with our Head of Recruiting and our client’s Executive Leadership team. Our team conducts two in-depth employment reference checks on all presented candidates at this stage. Client and candidate interviews are confirmed followed by detailed debrief post interview. Debrief feedback is shared with client through scheduled conference call. We tailor the interview process to align with our client’s internal process through the final interview step.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Placement and Onboarding:</strong> All job offers will be presented in written format by our clients, followed by compensation negotiation and candidate acceptance. Upon successful placement, we administer DISC assessments as a coaching and communication tool. The DISC model will help you better understand how your employee is motivated and what their communication style is.</p>
